for the login and register page we will be using context API
in the context folder there will be three files there which are 
    1. AuthActions.js
    2. AuthContext.js
    3. AuthReducer.js

Another thing to note is that when you are creating an onclick function pass e as a prop to prevent the page from refreshing each time we submit
and write inside the function e.preventDefault();

for any real world project we need state managemnt systems which could be contextAPI, redux, reducers!!


we wrap the react app into the <AuthContextProvider> goan check index.js for more
